                                    A payday advance is a confidential short term loan to get you by until your next
                                    paycheck. The money is electronically deposited into your account until the loan
                                    is due, in which it is debited on your payday.

                                    times we need occasional help. An increasing number of consumers are using payday
                                    advances to cover unexpected expenses between paydays with a payday loan. An unsecured
                                    personal loan is a short-term financial management tool providing a cost effective
                                    alternative to costly bounced checks, late payment charges, or tarnished credit

                                    account via an ACH transaction.

                                    the finance charge. Your due dates are determined by the day(s) in which you are
                                    paid.

                                    at least 72 hours before your loan is due. If they do not receive your renewal form
                                    by then they will assume that you want the full amount of the loan and the finance
                                    fee pulled on the pay date.

                                    Most lenders do not conduct a credit check. Instead they rely on your source of
                                    income as your collateral.

                                        you say?</b><br />
                                    Since the lender is authorized to use the Automated Clearing House System, they
                                    must adhere to NACHA rules and regulations. The amount to be withdrawn from your
                                    account will be the amount that you authorized.

                                    <b>FAQ: If sufficient funds will not be available on the loan due date, what should
                                        I do? </b>
                                    <br />
                                    Contact your lender. If you do not you will be charged an insufficient check charge
                                    in addition to your current balance. If the lender is not contacted, your account
                                    will be suspended until all monies are paid, and the collection process will begin.

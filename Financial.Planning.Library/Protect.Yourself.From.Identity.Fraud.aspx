                                good ideas to keep your good credit.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Using the ATMs, sometimes there are people around you that you believe that are
                                too close. Be aware of them and make sure that while you are pushing your pin number
                                that no-one can see, this is a great way to prevent identity fraud. So take some
                                measures to cover your entry, you can turn your body towards the other way or you
                                can cover your hand with the other one.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Be aware of those credit receipts, as some use this as an opportunity to commit
                                identity fraud, so watch your receipts as some still have your full account number
                                on it. Keep the receipts in a safe place until you balance your account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Purchase a shredder to curtail identity fraud. Don’t forget to shred any and all
                                unwanted documents especially with personal information on it. Anything with your
                                personal and confidential information on it you will want to shred. Have you often
                                wondered about your garbage? There are times that your garbage is sifted through
                                as your sleeping, so remember to shred those documents.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Monitor all of your accounts carefully, you will immediately know if there has been
                                an unauthorized purchased. If some credit cards aren’t being used close the account.
                                Sometimes cutting your credit card themselves, might not be enough to prevent identity
                                fraud.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Limit yourself to a few credit cards. Remember the more you have the harder it will
                                be to keep track of them and make it harder for identity fraud to happen to you.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Don’t forget credit reports. It is a good idea to receive your credit report at
                                least once a year so you will be able to better manage your credit and see quicker
                                if identity fraud has happened to you. And if any discrepancies come up you will
                                be able to address them immediately.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Mailing your bill, when you pay a bill with a check it is always better to drop
                                them directly off at the post office. When other people have access to your mailbox,
                                your check can easily be altered and address to another as this has contributed
                                to identity fraud for many.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When moving, contact all of your creditors and notify them of your move with your
                                new and complete address. You definitely don’t want personal information delivered
                                to the old address. If you feel that you have missed a statement call your creditor
                                immediately to better prevent identity fraud.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Your social security number, this is one set of numbers that you need to remember.
                                Never have your card out where it can be stolen. Only give it out when absolutely
                                necessary and never have it on your checks. This number in the wrong hands can be
                                absolutely devastating to you and your credit, which is a true example of identity
                                fraud.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Do not ever carry your social security card and your driver license together.
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                independently audited against identity fraud.

                                How to Choose a Financial Planner When Seeking Financial Advice
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                Very often financial planners are used for financial advice when you have a lot
                                of money and are looking for means to take care of it. Today you can use a financial
                                planner for your financial advice even if you don't have a large cash flow.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It is a good idea to obtain a financial planner for your financial advice if you
                                are having difficulties managing your money on your own. This article will show
                                you all the things you need to know to find the planner that will give you the soundest
                                financial advice, and is the right choice for you. The first thing you want to know
                                is how is your planner going to be compensated. You will need to understand how
                                they earn a living and what the costs of their services are. Will you be paying
                                a flat fee? Are their fees commissioned based? These are questions you need to ask.
                                You also want to talk to several planners before you choose just one for your financial
                                advice. The best option here is through word of mouth. As your neighbors, friends,
                                and co-workers where they get their financial advice from. Make sure the people
                                you ask have similar income and net worth as you as they will often have the same
                                objectives and mindset.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Here are some questions to ask prospective planners:
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1. How long have they been in business and how did they start off? How long have
                                they been giving financial advice? Don't assume that because they look older they
                                have more experience. Many people become planners after retiring. You want to find
                                someone that has been providing financial advice for at least 5 years.
                                <br /><br />
                                2. Ask them what their typical client profile is. See how many points resemble your
                                own. If it does, you may have a good match there. You want to see someone that provides
                                financial advice to at least 100 clients. You want to see they have routinely provided
                                financial advice to areas that are of concern to you.
                                <br /><br />
                                3. It is better to go to your planner's office rather than inviting them to your
                                home. Take note of a few things. How often does the phone ring before it is answered?
                                Is it organized and active?
                                <br /><br />
                                4. How do they treat you? You want a planner who will give you financial advice only
                                after learning your own needs first.
                                <br /><br />
                                5. Do they investigate your profile before providing financial advice? You want someone
                                who will review your profile on previous investments, insurance, taxes and real
                                estate as well as mortgages, college and retirement funds and so on.
                                <br /><br />
                                6. Do they discuss taxes? You want a planner that is going to consider tax implications
                                before giving financial advice and recommendations to you.
                                <br /><br />
                                7. Call the regulatory authorities like NASD and SEC to find out their record is
                                clean. You also want financial advice from someone who is a member of the Financial
                                Planning Association.
                                <br /><br />
                                8. Ask about investment methods. What investments do they work with and find out
                                if the money will be accessible. Who will make the decisions and can they perform
                                transactions without your approval?
                                <br /><br />
                                9. Will you need a contract? Never do obtain financial advice on a contract that
                                will not give you the option of canceling in 30 days or less. You also don’t want
                                to pay more than 50% ahead of time.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you are seeking financial advice, you may come across of letters and credentials.
                                These are the most common, and the ones you should look for:

                                It is important to note that all of these certifications are given by private organizations.
                                While they suggest a given amount of training or experience, none of them are required
                                or even recognized by federal regulatory agencies. Many planners hold none of these,
                                where a talented planner may have several.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                With your planner you will be receiving financial advice on investment, taxes, wills,
                                estate planning, mortgages, and trusts. All of your financial advice is designed
                                to help you meet your financial goals and obligations. If you choose the right planner,
                                they will become an important key in your life. After all, receiving financial advice
                                is a life long necessity!

                                Fast payday loans are the latest means of acquiring quick cash with a telephone
                                call, a fax, or an online application to cover those unexpected expenses that come
                                up between paydays. A fast payday loan is a short-term advance on the consumers
                                pay check. Seven to fourteen days is the usual term of this funding, but it can
                                be extended. The fee for each extension rises significantly. Some of the fees that
                                are posted on the Internet range from $10 to $18.62 for a $100 loan for seven to
                                fourteen days. Extensions are allowed for up to twenty-one days, but each week's
                                extension adds a hefty fee to the debt. Some companies offering fast payday loans
                                advertise "no faxes," presumably giving added privacy to applicants. However, most
                                require that the initial application, a voided check and bank statement be faxed
                                to them.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Applicants must be eighteen years or older, and must be depositing at least $1,000
                                a month in his or her account to be eligible for a fast payday loan. There is no
                                credit check necessary, presumably because of the short term and limited amount
                                of funding. Most lending companies offer from $100.00 to $1,500.00, depending upon
                                eligibility and need. Some companies offering fast payday loans will complete the
                                first transaction without charging a fee. This is often a marketing technique that
                                will encourage borrowers to return to the same company in the future for assistance.
                                <br />

                                This type of program can be of great assistance in urgent situations, but it can
                                also open the door to greater indebtedness. Unexpected expenses can come up in anyone's
                                life where a fast payday loan would help get through a crisis.
                                <br />

                                Fast payday loans for small businesses can help a business person access funds needed
                                to expand a new business or to help an existing business run smoothly. For example,
                                a businessman may need to buy business supplies or advertise his company. Many new
                                businesses find it difficult to obtain a traditional loan because they are not established,
                                which is a criteria maintained by many lending institutions. The entrepreneur may
                                also need to expand existing inventory, hire additional employees, or may be ready
                                to venture out of his home office. Not having the extra cash to buy supplies or
                                rent a bigger space limits the growth of the business. With these types of Internet
                                contracts, however, businesses can apply for funds that require no collateral required.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When approved, the borrower can have access to the money within two days or less.
                                These contracts can be given out based on the borrower's credit. Some Fast payday
                                loans companies offer a line of credit, and even checks that the applicant can use
                                to pay for small business expenses. These contracts range from $15,000 to $50,000.
                                The borrower does not have to provide any type of equity for Fast payday loans.
                                It is actually quite simple to apply for these deals. There are no upfront fees
                                or fees to process the application. In most cases, the applicant does not have to
                                provide financial documentation. Since the contract is unsecured, it is based solely
                                on the applicant's good credit.

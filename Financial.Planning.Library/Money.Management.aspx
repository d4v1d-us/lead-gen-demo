                                The most common resolutions people start every New Year falls into one of two categories
                                -- thinning their waistline AND their bottom line. Eat less spend less, what a great
                                way to start each year.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Living paycheck to paycheck does not mean you have poor cash management skills,
                                just that they need some tweaking. However, getting your finances into good form
                                is more time consuming than losing those holiday pounds. To help you get your wallet
                                back into shape, here are a few cash management tips to give you a sound financial
                                workout without too much pain.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1. Have a financial check-up. To find out where your hard-earned money is going,
                                list your monthly expenses down. Include every monthly bill, and estimate where
                                you do not have a fixed amount – such as groceries or gas. The first step in cash
                                management is determining where the money is going to begin with.
                                <br /><br />
                                2. Find the money pit. This does not mean your morning latte or your lunches at Applebee's.
                                While cutting these things out will only benefit you, find out where the meat of
                                your extra money is going. If you look over your credit card statements, something
                                will stick out that will be an indicator of over spending. Get into the habit of
                                cash management and cut those things out today. Don't wait to do it or you won't
                                do it at all, and your cash management plan will never happen.
                                <br /><br />
                                3. Now you have to trim the fat. You have already determined where the money pit
                                is, you need to dig a little deeper and get serious about cash management. This
                                means we are now going to talk about those lattes and Applebee lunches. Make clear,
                                conscious decisions about what is important to your family and simply get rid of
                                the rest of your expenses. Take a notebook with you and write down every purchase
                                you make. Most people find this cuts spending automatically as their attention is
                                drawn to it on paper. After a few weeks, review the notes and eliminate those lattes.
                                Now your cash management is on paper and you have no choice but to face it and own
                                it.
                                <br /><br />
                                4. Kick a habit. For some people this means smoking, for others it will mean carrying
                                high balances on your cards. Either way, make a resolution to kick something in
                                your life that is costing you money. This is the only way you are going to have
                                effective cash management.
                                <br /><br />
                                5. Review your credit reports annually. This is a healthy habit towards solid cash
                                management. The Fair Credit Transactions Act will grant you one free credit report
                                annually from each of the major bureaus.
                                <br /><br />
                                6. Gather the family together and go through your cash management plan together.
                                It is important that everyone that is affected by the plan is fully aware of it.
                                This may prevent your teenage daughter from racking up the text messaging bills
                                – if you're lucky.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The greatest failure of all cash management plans is that they do not fit with the
                                way we WANT to spend money. We live in a society that is based on spending, not
                                on cash management. We are practically conditioned to fail in this consumer driven
                                society. The good news is, there is only three ways we can spend our money: pay
                                bills, save, or daily living. Since we have three ways to spend money, we need three
                                ways towards cash management to accommodate each of these needs. By trimming expenses,
                                saving regularly, and sticking to a cash management budget, we will be able to meet
                                all of our cash management needs. Remember, a good cash management systems is much
                                more than number crunching. It is subject to life's up's and downs and your cash
                                management plan is going to change as your life does. Be prepared to handle these
                                situations and do not let them stress you out. Do not let it discourage you. Revise
                                your cash management plan periodically to suit your needs, and review it annually.
                                This kind of cash management plan will ensure you are utilizing your income the
                                best way available.

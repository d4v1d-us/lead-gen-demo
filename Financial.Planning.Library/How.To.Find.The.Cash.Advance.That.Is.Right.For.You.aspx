                                When you are looking for a payday loan or cash advance lender a few things you will
                                want to consider are:
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                • Is this a reputable company?
                                <br />
                                • Does their website appear to be professionally designed and managed?
                                <br />
                                • Are you easily able to contact their customer service department?
                                <br />
                                • Do their customer services representatives provide professional, friendly service?
                                <br />
                                • Is their application process secure?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When looking at a particular payday loan lender you should feel free to e-mail them
                                at their contact information and ask any questions you have about their application
                                process, the terms of the cash advance, the security of their online payday loan
                                process and any other concerns you may have. Security is a major concern when shopping
                                for the right payday loan. When a client completes the <a href="http://vipcashfast.com/" title="Click for Cash Advance Payday Loan Application"
                                            class="">vipcashfast.com</a> application
                                page, the connection will be “SSL” which stands for Secure Socket Layer. Secure
                                Socket Layers provide the best means of encryption available to commercial websites
                                today. Ask any payday loan lender you consider doing business with about their data
                                security. You might be surprised at their responses. If they are evasive or unclear
                                in their answers, go somewhere else! If getting to a fax machine is difficult for
                                you then you also may want to ask the company you are considering whether they offer
                                a no fax payday loan process. You will want to make sure their site provides clear
                                information about how long it will take to receive your money and if you will be
                                able to renew or extend your cash advance. Getting Approved For Your Payday Loan
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1. Check the payday loan lender’s qualification policy to make sure you’re eligible.
                                It’s actually detrimental to fill out an application if you know you don’t qualify.
                                It may hurt your chances with another payday advance lender whose qualifications
                                you do meet.
                                <br /><br />
                                2. When shopping quick cash advance loan, limit the number of applications you actually
                                fill out and submit. Filling out multiple applications can result in being declined
                                by many payday loan lenders. Each time you apply for a cash advance, that application
                                is reported to a consumer tracking database used by banks and payday loan lenders.
                                If your payday loan lenders see multiple applications pending they assume that their
                                exposure or risk will be greater.
                                <br /><br />
                                3. Fill out your application completely and accurately. Many applicants think that
                                exaggerating may help them (longer time on job than they really have, higher income
                                than they really have, etc.) If a lender finds that you are exaggerating or lying
                                they may decline your request for a payday loan immediately. Your contact information
                                must also be accurate; if they are unable to reach you or your employer your application
                                may be declined.
                                <br /><br />
                                4. When you talk to or send email correspondence to the customer service department,
                                be courteous and professional.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Finally, make sure someone is available to answer your all your application questions.
                                Many payday loan lenders leave you wondering what’s going on. Although price is
                                important, customer service is even more important. At <a href="http://vipcashfast.com/" title="Click for Cash Advance Payday Loan Application"

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                After You Get a Payday Loan What if the unexpected happens and you cannot pay off
                                your short term loan on the maturity date? Contact the payday loan lender regarding
                                repayment options. Most payday loan lenders are flexible, and offer different options
                                or rollovers on the loan amount. You should be prepared to pay the initial fee again,
                                however. Try to pay back the fee and as much of the principal as possible. The most
                                important rule of all: do not default on the payday loan! The payday loan company
                                may send your account to a third party collections agency, which could be very detrimental
                                to your long term credit options. In addition, if you default you may be reported
                                to consumer credit agencies that can make it difficult for you to obtain another
                                payday loan or cash advance.

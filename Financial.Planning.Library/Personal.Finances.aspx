                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The first thing you must ask yourself, “Am I ready to become a home buyer?” You
                                will need to know if you are financially ready to proceed with become a home buyer.
                                It is recommended by some experts that a first time home buyer should ask themselves
                                a few questions:
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1. Am I living within my means, avoiding any credit card debt?
                                <br />
                                2. Do I have enough money saved up for my down payment and my closing cost?
                                <br />
                                3. Is my current job steady and my income reliable?
                                <br />
                                4. Do I have any emergency funds available to me? In case of an emergency.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Being a first time home buyer can be an extremely stressful time, so take into consideration
                                if you are truly able to withstand the stress that you are about to endure. Make
                                sure that you feel that you are emotionally prepared for this new endeavor, as there
                                will be many hurdles to overcome in becoming a home buyer.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As many of the first time home buyers are use to renting, there will be an adjustment
                                to make when you become a home buyer as you will need to budget a little bit differently.
                                It is a great idea to have some reserve funds that are available to you in case
                                of any type of emergencies. And remember, if you are purchasing a new or old home
                                things can go wrong and items will need to be replaced as you will no longer have
                                a landlord when you become a home buyer.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The next big step would be to make sure that you can afford to become a home buyer.
                                When you feel the time is right to become a home buyer you will need to determine
                                exactly how much you can afford to spend on become a home buyer. It is recommended
                                that you get pre-qualified for a home buyer loan. There are those that prefer customers
                                and clients to be pre-qualify before they even place an offer on the table to become
                                a home buyer.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are a few options out there that you can utilize to become pre-qualified for
                                a home buyer loan. You can go to your financial institution and qualify with them,
                                you can locate a real estate agent that you may already know or have already had
                                some communications with, or you can go directly to a specific lender. Some experts
                                say that going with someone that you already have established a relationship with
                                could be beneficial to you in becoming a home buyer as they may go that extra mile
                                for you.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Now remember that you total monthly mortgage when you become a home buyer will include
                                what is known as PITI which means Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance as this
                                should not be over 30% of your gross monthly income. You can also speak with your
                                lender if you have any questions with regards to becoming a home buyer and the process
                                that it takes to succeed in your new endeavor.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It is recommended and a great idea to seek out those special lenders that may have
                                special financing or a first time mortgage home buyer option as this may be able
                                to take into consideration any special needs that you may have.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you are able to locate a lender that does offer a first time home buyer option
                                you might be able to put no money down or a small amount down for your home buyer
                                loan. If are required to put some money down some lenders will allow you to use
                                money that was given to you for the sole purpose of this down payment, better known
                                as a gift. Also, some special programs might also allow you to pay no closing costs
                                or you might also be able to put your closing costs into your loan. If you have
                                any questions about this you should contact your lender and inquire about your home
                                buyer loan and your options.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As I’m sure you are aware of the bigger the down payment that you have in becoming
                                a home buyer, the lower your mortgage will be and the less that you are borrowing
                                against.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The next exciting step would be the location of your new home. If you don’t already
                                know where you want to live this is a great time to do some research and figure
                                out the best location for your home buyer. Are you looking for a two-story, ranch
                                style home, or a town home? Your best research would be to drive around town in
                                the area that you would like to become a home buyer in. You may also look on the
                                internet where there are many websites that have pictures of the homes, that you
                                can get a better look and get a better idea of what to expect so you can become
                                a home buyer in your dream neighborhood.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you have located that special house that you want to become a home buyer in,
                                you will want to get the house inspected. Your lender can refer you to several home
                                inspector as the cost can vary from $200–400. When you become a home buyer you will
                                want to have your home inspected as there can be many hidden issues and problems.
                                This can become a bargaining tool for you as the home buyer and negotiate with the
                                seller to fix the problems that were found.

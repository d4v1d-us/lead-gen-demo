                                <br />What you need to know to fix your
                                credit report score. If you suspect incomplete, outdated and inaccurate information
                                you should contact the Credit Reporting Agencies as soon as possible. Anytime you
                                suspect fraud report it to the police and to your creditors. Remember to never send
                                original documents, make two copies, one for you and the other goes to the Credit
                                Reporting Agencies. When you send copies of your documents remember to sign it with
                                your full name, date being mailed, and time.

                                <br />
                                When you are ready to contact the Credit Reporting Agency get a copy of your current
                                credit report to verify any discrepancies, you may be able to get a free credit
                                report.
                                <br />

                                the Credit Reporting Agency will review it and decide whether or not further investigation
                                is needed. They will also send their findings to the Creditor which will conduct
                                their own investigation and forward their findings back to the Credit Bureau. If
                                any updates are needed their records will reflect such changes and notify you of
                                the updates.

                                After disputing an item on your credit report and it still doesn’t get resolved
                                you can always submit a statement, which needs to be under 100 words, letting creditors
                                know of the specifics of your disputed item. Just write a brief descriptive letter
                                explaining the reasoning of your dispute. So, all current and future creditors will
                                be able to read your statement explaining for the deficiency.

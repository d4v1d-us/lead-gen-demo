                                There is no time like the present to start your emergency fund account. You don’t
                                need to start large, you can start with something small and work your way up to
                                build your emergency fund account. It all depends on your particular need, your
                                income, expenses, and the size of your family to figure out exactly how much you
                                can truly afford to put aside each paycheck for your emergency fund account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As many of us go out to lunch with our co-workers, we stop in the morning to get
                                that cup of coffee that we were running too late to make and you figure that it’s
                                just a few bucks that it doesn’t matter, but in reality a few dollars a day or a
                                few dollars each meal time does and can add up that could go towards your emergency
                                fund account. You might want to take the time and write down every dollar and every
                                cent that you pay out and keep track of it for about a week and you will find that
                                a few dollars here and a few dollars there can quickly add up, in time, to a lot
                                of money that could have gone into your emergency fund account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                By taking out some extras that you normally spend each week or each month you can
                                accumulate some extra money that can go towards your emergency fund account. You
                                can easily save hundreds of dollars each month by cutting out any extra like going
                                out to eat, cook from home instead to build your emergency fund account. You would
                                be amazed at saving a few dollars a day can equal up to a lot more by the end of
                                the month which means more money for your emergency fund account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A great way to start is to set a certain amount of money each paycheck that you
                                want to put into your emergency fund account and tell yourself that this is a bill
                                that you must pay each paycheck. If you can program yourself into thinking this
                                it will make it easier on you and your family that money being set aside four your
                                emergency fund account is not even being missed can only be beneficial to you.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You can also check with your back to open up a separate account for your emergency
                                fund account that can easily be direct deposited into your account. If your money
                                is being automatically deposited into a separate account what you don’t see you
                                won’t miss. Being consistent is the key to your emergency fund account and prioritize
                                the importance of this you can truly accomplish your goal by getting your emergency
                                fund account funded with at least a few months of expenses for any emergencies that
                                can be unforeseen.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Another great way to save a few bucks would be to get your favorite jar or the old
                                fashioned piggy bank and start putting a few bucks in it as you can. You can also
                                empty your pockets or your change purse at the end of each day or week and you will
                                be amazed on how that extra change can become quite a bit towards your emergency
                                fund account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                One way to limit your daily and weekly spending, take only a few dollars with you
                                as you won’t spend what you don’t have. Remember, saving a few dollars a day over
                                time can accumulate to quite a bit at the end of the month towards your goal of
                                building an emergency fund account that could help you out for any unexpected expenses
                                that might come your way.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you have recently paid off any long term debt keep making those payments and
                                just get the money relocated to your emergency fund account as this can quickly
                                add up to some extra cash. Remember being consistent in your endeavor in raising
                                some extra money for your emergency fund account can only be truly beneficial to
                                you when you truly need it. Because we all know that unexpected expenses always
                                seem to come up when we least expect it and when we are not ready for.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When filing your tax return and you know that you will be receiving some money back,
                                use that money and put a partial amount or the entire check towards your emergency
                                fund account. This would be a great way to get caught up from any earlier unexpected
                                expenses already spent.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You can also cut back on any daily or weekly activities that you might normally
                                enjoy like smoking, going to the movies, or shopping. The money that you might have
                                spent or a fraction of that money can go into your emergency fund account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you have a washing machine and a dryer you can place quarters in a jar like you
                                would if you had to go to the Laundromat. This would be another great alternative
                                to save an extra few bucks that can go towards your emergency fund account. Also,
                                you can cut down on your dry cleaning or just stop going and iron your clothes your
                                self.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As some might not see the true need for an emergency fund account, but with some
                                discipline and consistency you can, in time, accumulate quite a large emergency
                                fund account. When you least expect it your car might break down or your clothes
                                dryer decides not to work on you, but you won’t have to panic. Why? Because you
                                have worked hard to save some money that is located in your emergency fund account.
                                So, remember a little bit at a time can go a long way that can ease your stress
                                at a later time and by keeping your emergency funds out of your immediate reach
                                can deter the impulse to access it for your wants and not your needs. Once you have
                                learned the difference between wants and needs and build your consistency in saving
                                a few dollars here and a few dollars there you will quickly accumulate money into
                                your emergency fund account that you can be proud of.

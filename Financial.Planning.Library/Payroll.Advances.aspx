                                Payroll advances are easy to come by because all that is needed is identification,
                                proof of employment, a copy of a last pay stub, a current bank statement, and a
                                blank check. They can come in the form of cash, direct deposit into a checking account,
                                or a credit to a credit card. In most cases, the borrower can have a payroll advance
                                direct deposited into an account overnight up to $1500. Funds are made based upon
                                the consistent amounts that are deposited into a borrowers account each month. The
                                lending company will ask the applicant to bring in a bank statement and a voided
                                check. If the application is approved, the loan will be deposited into a bank account
                                overnight. The borrower may be required to have all bank documents faxed in to the
                                lending company before 4:00 p.m. in order to receive the funds the next day.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                All applicants must be aware, though, that bank hours and holidays could affect
                                the availability of the funds. If the loan is approved on a Friday, funds will not
                                be available until the next Monday. Payroll advance companies are businesses that
                                have deadlines and terms that have to be met. If one is unable to make the full
                                payment of the loan, call the lending company and receive suggested optional methods
                                of repayment. In most instances, the borrower will be granted an extension for a
                                small fee. The borrower may be granted three extensions until they have to begin
                                paying more for the loan. The amount of an extension fee is based on the amount
                                that was originally borrowed. Payroll advances should only be taken out one at a
                                time. It is usually not a good idea to take out more than one, since that will make
                                it more difficult to pay back the money borrowed.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Some lending companies share information with each other. If they see that the applicant
                                currently have an active payroll advance loan, they will most likely deny the request
                                for a new one. Try to pay off all current payroll advances before committing money
                                to another one. The goal is to help the borrower stay ahead, not get further into
                                debt. This type of funding is given to people with bad credit. They do not check
                                an applicant's credit history, they only check to see that the applicant does not
                                have a current loan active or in default. If the borrower has filed bankruptcy,
                                they may still be eligible. As long as the applicant is not currently in bankruptcy,
                                there is a good chance of approval.
                                <br />

                                A payroll advances is a personal loan available to anyone who has stumbled into
                                an emergency financial situation, has a pressing issue that just can't wait or has
                                just found their extra income a little slender one week. If this sounds familiar,
                                an advance loan on employment income may be the answer. There are many reasons why
                                a person may find themselves in a financial bind and need payroll advances. Fortunately,
                                there are a variety of organizations ready to help with this problem. The funds
                                can be sought online or in person and require very little effort on the borrower's
                                part.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This type of financing can be approved and sent within 24 hours, overnight or approved
                                within one hour. The funds can even be directly wired into the borrower's bank account,
                                either checking or savings. The online process for a payroll advances takes only
                                a few minutes and some are faxless, offering safe and secure sites to protect the
                                borrower's information. For those who have limited access to the Internet, there
                                are several storefront brands, specifically for payroll advances, that have begun
                                to sweep the nation and are easily accessible. Those can be located in a local telephone
                                book or advertised with local television commercials. These local locations are
                                ideal for the borrower who feels safer doing business in person. Whether the application
                                is filled out on the Internet or in person, the premise remains the same: someone
                                needs money and an organization is willing to lend it.

                                Instant cash loans can help qualified borrowers receive money to pay those delinquent
                                bills on time. These financial contracts can be completed in minutes. Today, the
                                Internet has provided a means for people to get money fast with less hassle. Instant
                                cash loans are available for a variety of reasons, including to catch up delinquent
                                payments, consolidate loans, get relief from high interest accounts. A borrower
                                may acquire as little as $100 or as much as $1000 to help him out of his financial
                                predicament. The money is deposited safely in the borrower's checking account from
                                the comforts of his home.

                                For the person who has bills due with insufficient funds to cover them, an instant
                                cash loan can solve the problem. For the person with an immediate need but no money
                                in the bank, quick funds are available. The beauty of these loans is that no one
                                will ask the borrower what his need is. They are not granted based on need nor on
                                credit history. Most are granted based on the borrower's current employment status
                                and income. For the person who has bills due with insufficient funds to cover them,

                                of a home over the Internet. No more embarrassing interviews, and no more hassles

                                These contracts are now easier than ever to qualify for, and they are becoming a
                                very competitive business. As lenders are jumping into the market for instant cash
                                loans, rates and fees are dropping. Now, funds can be borrowed for as little as
                                twelve percent. If a debtor pays back his instant cash loan in a timely manner,
                                it can cost less than a bounced check fee. The secret to successfully handling a
                                contract is to never abuse the availability and to always pay, in full, the entire
                                loan amount on the due date. The ease of gaining instant cash loans can prove to
                                be tempting and wisdom and discernment should always be used when taking on additional
                                debt. Before signing on the dotted line, a Christian should take his financial concerns
                                to God in prayer and ask Him to guide through the financial crisis.

                                Instant cash loan provide a confidential and quick way to obtain short-term, unsecured
                                money to cover unexpected or emergency expenses from the convenience of one's home
                                computer. This funding is relatively easy to obtain, provided one meets the basic
                                eligibility requirements of the lender, but this convenience comes at a price. To
                                obtain an instant cash loan, one must be over 18 years old, have a checking account,
                                and a job which provides a steady income. Some lenders require that an individual
                                has been steadily employed for at least 3 months and earns at least $1000 per month.
                                Individuals apply for the loan online and responses are very fast, typically within
                                a few hours. Credit checks are not a part of the approval process, so bad credit
                                does not prevent a person from securing this assistance.

                                Once approved, the approved amount of money is directly deposited into the borrower's
                                checking account overnight. Typical instant cash loan amounts range from $100-$500,
                                depending on the borrower's monthly income. The duration of the loan is until the
                                borrower's next payday, at which time the loan amount and the finance charge will
                                be automatically deducted from the individual's checking account. The borrower can
                                often extend the length of instant cash loan past the initial period, but APRs are
                                high and interest charges quickly add up.Once approved, the approved amount of money

                                The ease and convenience of this process often comes at a price. The finance charge
                                for an instant cash loan is typically $20-$25 per $100 borrowed. The Truth in Lending
                                Act requires that lenders fully disclose the terms of the loan upfront, including
                                the annual percentage rate (APR). Because these loans are for such a short amount
                                of time, a typical APR can be 400-500%. Lenders usually offer loan extensions, which
                                give the borrower more time to pay back the loan but compound finance charges. This
                                can make it even more difficult for a person to clear their debt and borrowers can
                                become stuck in a cycle of ever increasing finance charges and debt.

                                Online cash advances can help a person "get back on their feet", but the loan should
                                be paid off as quickly as possible. If a borrower pays off the full amount before
                                the due date, a portion of the finance charge is refunded. Being informed about
                                an instant cash loan will allow the individual to make a wise and educated decision.

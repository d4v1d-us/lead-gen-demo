                                Do you have too many students loans? Are you making several different loan payments?
                                Do you have several student loans and are thinking about consolidating them? You
                                are not alone in this endeavor as many of us have several student loans and are
                                interested in consolidating them but not sure if it’s in our best interest.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Once you have completed all of your school work and have graduated from college
                                now would be the time to figure out what to do about your student loans. Normally,
                                when you graduate from college you will have accumulated a large sum of debt known
                                as your student loans. Consolidating all of your student loans can be a great idea
                                if you have several lenders for your student loans. It can definitely help you in
                                keeping track of your student loans if they were consolidated down with one or two
                                different lenders. Dealing with several different lenders at the same time with
                                different payment due dates can be time consuming and very frustrating as you will
                                soon see. So, now would be the time to do your homework, so to speak and get all
                                the information that you can about consolidating your student loan.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A great idea would be to ask your friends and family, with what did they do after
                                they graduated from college about their student loans. It always a great idea to
                                ask people that you know and trust what they did and what worked best for them.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Unfortunately, as we all know to every solution there are several pros and cons
                                to consolidating your student loans. Here are some things to think about before
                                you consolidate your student loans.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                PRO: When you consolidate your student loan this can assist you in locking at a
                                lower rate. Recently, student loans rates are at a low which makes this the perfect
                                time to consolidate your student loan. So, when you decide to consolidate your student
                                loan your new and current interest rate will be averaged with your current student
                                loans. Another, idea is if you don’t consolidate your student loans your interest
                                rates could increase in the years to come.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                CON: Sometimes consolidating your student loan can increase your overall cost of
                                your loan. So when you decide to consolidate your student loan so beware by doing
                                so your debts are combined into your new loan with a longer repayment term. Depending
                                on the length of your new student loan it can lower your monthly payments but it
                                will increase your long term interest of our loan. So, if you can pay off your student
                                loan fairly quickly, it might not be a good idea to consolidate.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                PRO: Consolidating your student loans will definitely make it much easier to manage
                                as you will only have one or two bills. When you have several lenders to deal with
                                regards to your student loan it will be hard to keep track of when to pay. When
                                your student loan has been consolidated you will only have one lender to deal with
                                as this can definitely decrease your stress and be easier to manage on a monthly
                                basis.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                CON: When consolidating your student loan balance must exceed $10,000 and you must
                                have graduated and you can not be defaulted on any of your student loans. There
                                will be some requirements with regards to consolidating your student loan as it
                                must be from some certain lenders.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                PRO: On the bright side consolidating your student loans definitely has some advantages.
                                By consolidating your student loans this can help increase your credit score which
                                will limit your open and active accounts. Once you downsize from student loans with
                                several lenders to one or two, will show up on your credit report as paid and closed.
                                If you make your payments on time after you graduate can also assist you in getting
                                a better rate for your student loans.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                CON: Depending on your circumstances consolidating your student loan might not be
                                the best option for you. There are several programs out there that may be available
                                to you that can assist you in repaying your student loan or get them forgiven. There
                                are government programs out there that might assist you in repaying your student
                                loan by doing some community services and becoming a teacher in a predetermined
                                geographically location. If you have a Perkins loan there maybe opportunities out
                                there for you to have your student loan forgiven.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are a lot of resources that are within your reach and you just need to know
                                where to look for them. An easy resource would be the internet, your banking financial
                                institution, or a family member. You just need to know what questions to ask and
                                how to ask them as your objective is to make your life easier and your student debt
                                easier to manage on a monthly basis. Having several different lenders can be confusing
                                and hard to handle as each of your lenders will have a different way of doing business
                                and collecting on their debt. So, it will be beneficial to you to find out about
                                each of your lender and what is expected of your student loan repayment plan. It
                                never hurts to call up your lender and ask them questions and possible make other
                                arrangement.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                So, before you consolidate your student loan you might want to do some thorough
                                research and find out the pros and cons that will be suit your specific needs. As
                                graduating from college is stressful enough time, worrying about your student loans
                                will be hard enough to manage.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Remember, consolidating your student loan and having one monthly payment can be
                                easier to manage and make your life a lot easier, but before you make that first
                                big step find out everything that you can and then make your decision as this is
                                one debt that you don’t want to default on.

                                <br />

                                Given our credit based society, debt load is an all too familiar term with every
                                American. It does not take long for someone with little financial planning experience
                                or budgeting know-how to fall into the trap of credit overload.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                With credit comes debt. And when that happens and it becomes overwhelming, bankruptcy
                                is an all too often sought out answer. A lot of people have the mindset that filing
                                bankruptcy will just enable them to start fresh with a clean slate. This article
                                is going to try and banish those thoughts and show you that bankruptcy is not the
                                answer. Financial planning and money management are the keys to getting out of debt.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Talk to anyone that has gone through a bankruptcy. They will tell you that it is
                                a life-changing experience that causes emotional havoc for years to come. It has
                                been listed as one of the top five life-altering stressors that we can go through.
                                It has been known to end marriages, lives even. Bankruptcy is certainly not a means
                                of starting over. Even after discharge, you will always be asked on loan or job
                                applications if you have ever filed for bankruptcy. A common myth is that credit
                                repair services will fix the damage from going bankrupt. This is simply not the
                                case. Your bankruptcy will follow you forever.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are two kinds of bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is total bankruptcy and will stay on
                                your credit report for 10 years. All assets will be liquefied and you will lose
                                everything. You will need to qualify for a chapter 7 through a means test. You can
                                not go to a bankruptcy lawyer with a few thousand dollars debt and just try to “get
                                out of it”. Chapter 13 depends on what the value of your assets are, and is more
                                like a payment plan. You will still be able to retain some of your assets, and make
                                payments to your creditors. It is still a bankruptcy however, and will stay on your
                                credit bureau for seven years. There are some things a bankruptcy won’t release
                                you from. You will still have to pay child support, alimony, fines, taxes, and your
                                student loans. You also will not be allowed to keep any property unless you have
                                paid for it in full.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                One option you have is to go through a debt management company. These are financial
                                planners that will help you control your debt load by taking one monthly payment
                                from you and distributing it to your creditors. They act on your behalf to lower
                                your payments and your interest. These are often considered a last resort to bankruptcy
                                however as it will go on your credit report, and your credit will be considered
                                poor. If you are in debt over your head however, you already have bad credit and
                                it is a more feasible option than bankruptcy. Financial budgeting and debt payoff
                                are probably the most effective means to good financial health. If you work hard
                                with sound financial planning and are willing to make some sacrifices for a few
                                years, this will be the best long term option for you. You can pay off your debt,
                                get focused on your budget, maybe even work some extra jobs. There will be no long-term
                                credit effects to you. You will also be establishing skills needed to stay debt-free
                                and have a better quality of life. This option is the most difficult, but will pay
                                off in spades for the long-term.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Just about any financial situation can be resolved and bankruptcy avoided with the
                                proper assistance and financial planning. You are going to have to undergo serious
                                money management bootcamp, but this will fare far better for you than total asset
                                dissolution. It will be painful and trying, but bankruptcy is much more difficult
                                to go through. If you take a sound step forward towards financial planning and money
                                management, you can avoid bankruptcy.

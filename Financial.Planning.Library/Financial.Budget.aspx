                                Financial Budget
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Too often a sound financial budget is forgotten
                                <br />
                                <br />
                            </p>

                                The average North American household holds a current credit card debt of over $9,300.
                                Credit card companies take advantage of that by making running up your balance extremely
                                convenient. Today, carrying debt is almost unavoidable, and in most cases, desirable
                                and necessary for some households.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Between mortgages, credit cards, car payments, and retirement funds, many Americans
                                are finding themselves over their heads and unable to dig out of its hold. Their
                                growing debt consumes the largest part of their incoming resources. Creating a sound
                                financial budget can be difficult, and daunting, but every person that carries debt,
                                is capable of doing it.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The first thing you need to do is find out how much debt you have, and how much
                                is too much for you. This varies on an individual and income basis. If more than
                                20% of your take-home pay is going towards debt that is non-housing based, and your
                                rent or mortgage exceeds 30% of your take home pay, then you are more than likely
                                overextended. It is time for you to kick your financial budgeting into gear.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Signs that you do not have a financial budget include not knowing how much debt
                                you have, consistently paying minimum balances on your credit cards, and borrowing
                                from one card or lender to pay another. Don’t panic. There are a number of steps
                                you can follow to establish a good financial budget, and eliminate that debt to
                                get yourself back on track. Working your way out of debt and establishing a sound
                                financial budget you can stick with is going to require you to adjust your spending
                                habits.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The first key to establishing a financial budget is to find out where you money
                                is going. This will allow you to see where the debt load is coming from, and maybe
                                help you free up some cash towards the debt. Track your expenses for 30 days by
                                physically writing out what you are spending your money on. Keep your ATM slips
                                and write down on it each expense you have until your cash is gone. Hang onto your
                                credit card slips as well, and add those to the total.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                At the end of the 30 days, add up your outgoing funds and break them into categories.
                                You should have an essential group for your fixed expenses like housing, groceries,
                                and your electrical/water/cable/phone bills or any other utilities. Then add up
                                the costs for your next category, the nonessentials. This will include entertainment,
                                meals, clothing, and things of that nature. Analyze the expenses to see where you
                                can reduce your spending. Can you cut back on some of your phone features? Can you
                                bring a lunch to work everyday? How about making your coffee at home and bringing
                                it with you in a thermal mug? Even your electricity or heating costs can be cut
                                by bringing the thermostat down a bit in the winter, and up a bit in the summer.
                                The goal here is to decrease your current spending so you are not adding to your
                                debt. You also will be freeing up as much cash as possible to cut down on current
                                debt. This is the foundation to a good financial budget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Once you have your initial financial budget settled, you can start to attack your
                                existing debt with the following steps on your credit lines:
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1. Pay off the high rate cards first. The higher your rate, the more you are paying
                                out for nothing. Begin with your highest rated card and get rid of the balance as
                                aggressively as possible.
                                <br /><br />
                                2. Transfer the high rate debt to a lower rated card. This will save on interest
                                expenses over the life of the loan.
                                <br /><br />
                                3. If you must borrow again, do so only for the long term. Only finance things that
                                will gain in value like a house, education, or home appliances that will still be
                                around when the debt is paid off.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                By following these simple steps, you too can create a sound financial budget and
                                decrease your debt. The key to a good financial budget is analyzing spending, control
                                expenses, establish a plan, and reduce your debt load. This financial budget will
                                leave you with more money to save today and a brighter financial outlook in the
                                future.

                                Are you making ends meet? Not enough money in savings or your 401K? Wondering how
                                to save money?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As there are many people out there that struggle everyday with these types of questions
                                with regards to their finances. Everyone has the dream to become rich with their
                                finances and be able to retire when the time is right, but many of us struggle in
                                becoming wealthy with our finances. Here are some ideas where you can fix your mistakes
                                and become better with your finances.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As most of us are home owners with a 30 year mortgage and really have never given
                                it a second thought as we thought it was a great finance decision. But at the end
                                of your 30 year mortgage most of us will have spent over 2 ½ times the actual purchase
                                price from principal and interest alone as we can see our finances stretching out.
                                But if you have a 15 year mortgage instead of the more popular 30 year mortgage
                                you can save thousands of dollars that could evidentially increase your finances.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                By taking control of your finances whether you are married or not can take the risk
                                out of your hands and put it back into your finances. When you allow someone else
                                to handle the day to day finances and if something happens to that person like an
                                illness or a divorce you will have no idea about your current finances as this can
                                put you at risk. You should always know the details of your current family finances
                                with regards to your IRA, 401k, your spouse’s investments, and anything else that
                                you spend your money on. You should never allow someone else to take complete control
                                of your finances as you may never know the true account for it.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Uncontrollable spending sprees can one day be your downfall to your personal finances.
                                Now-a-days many people have become severely in credit card debt as spending a few
                                dollars here and there will add up in time which can have a bad affect with your
                                finances.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Just remember to spend your money wisely and to monitor the small spending as spending
                                a few dollars a day for lunch can add up in time and end up costing you thousands
                                of dollars. If you are ever to manage your finances you must manage your spending
                                habits.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Planning ahead can be a great tool for personal growth and better finances. You
                                should know where you are headed and how you plan on getting there. To arrive at
                                better finances you must have a plan, as many of us don’t and live paycheck to paycheck
                                there is something that we can do about it. You will need to start with your plan
                                and you should be excited about your plan as this can carry into increasing your
                                finances for a better gain.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A great way to start you new plan is to have a specific thing that you want to save
                                for, as this can motivate your new finances. You might want to start writing down
                                your plan and goals as you can visualize what you are planning and start taking
                                steps in increasing your finances.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Have too much debt? As many Americans are living beyond their means and are knee
                                deep in financial debt that are spending their money on interest payments which
                                will not allow you to have extra money for your savings. When you use your credit
                                card and don’t pay if off at the end of the month you might end up paying for the
                                item and the same amount in interest as it quickly accumulates with your finances.
                                You should stay away from using your credit cards and try to pay for your purchases
                                with cash, as you should remember that if you can’t afford to pay cash for it then
                                you probably can’t afford the item. This would be a great way to increase your finances
                                and become more financially stable.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Have you started saving for your retirement and think it’s too late? Well you definitely
                                are not alone in this question as many Americans have not saved enough money for
                                their retirement. When you first start out in the business world you believe that
                                you have plenty of time to start saving for your retirement and before you know
                                it you are in your thirties or forties with little or no money in your retirement.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you are over forty and you don’t have enough in your retirement savings account
                                you will want to start saving a larger amount as you are a bit behind in increasing
                                your finances for your retirement. It is recommended that you save about 10-15%
                                of your income towards your retirement.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Have you thought about cashing out your funds? Many of us have found ourselves in
                                dire need of immediate cash as our finances have recently taken a hit. There are
                                a lot of people that have taken out money from their 401(K) when they changed jobs.
                                Others have taken loans out from their 401(K) which reduces the amount that they
                                have accumulated for their finances. As many of us would like to have a larger retirement
                                fund the 401(K) is a great way to ensure that you have money when you decide to
                                retire. So, when you are down on your luck try to resist the urge in taking some
                                money out of your 401(K) as this will only hurt you in the end.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                By avoiding these common mistakes you can have a better finance outlook as you will
                                have a retirement fund that is growing interest as we speak. As many Americans dream
                                of becoming financially stable, you will want to have plan, budget, and a retirement
                                account to better secure your future. It is never too late to start, but if you
                                do start later in life you will want to increase your percentage as it will take
                                more money to get caught up and be more secured with your finances.

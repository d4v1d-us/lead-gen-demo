                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You can learn how to tell the difference between your needs, wants, and desire.
                                Gas, electric, water, groceries, car payment(s), mortgage payment definitely falls
                                under the needs category. Over time with this knowledge you will learn to spend
                                your money on your true needs first to live within your budget and earn your right
                                in having your wants you will soon be on your way in having a successful monthly
                                budget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A great reminder to have and know is to always pay your bills that are your true
                                needs first and you will be less likely to spend the little extra that you may have
                                on your wants. This is a great way to start your budget and once you do this a few
                                times and get into the habit of this new way to budget your expenses it will become
                                easier to budget your money.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                On the daily basis that you notice that the people around you go out for lunch or
                                order in make the decision to bring your lunch. By bringing your lunch to work can
                                save you a few dollars a day which can add up to quite a bit of savings on your
                                budget. The drawback of this idea would be that you might feel left out of the group
                                outing. If this is the case, maybe you can manage to budget a few extra dollars
                                either per week or once a month to go out to lunch with your coworkers. But don’t
                                make it more than that by sticking with your budget you will notice a difference
                                with a little bit of extra savings and the opportunity to buy a few of your wants
                                and desires.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                One of the biggest source of your debts can be your vehicle. By keeping up with
                                your regular maintenance on your vehicle can definitely prolong the life of it,
                                which can save you money that will help in maintaining your budget. If those monthly
                                payments seem to never end talk to your bank about maybe refinancing it to either
                                pay it off or lower your monthly payments. You may have the option to trade your
                                car in for a cheaper vehicle, which can also save you money with your budget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Another idea you might want to think about that can lower your expense to better
                                manage your budget would be to consolidate your credit cards. Your credit cards
                                might just be a huge expense that can really put a large dent into your monthly
                                budget. By consolidating your credit cards can cut extra expenses like finance charges
                                that can be put under one card. You could also look around for another credit card
                                that might just have a lower interest rate that could save you money on your budget.
                                By consolidating your credit cards to maybe one or two this will limit your time
                                and money to fewer items to pay and lower finance and extra charges all into one
                                credit card that can save you money with your budget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This could be a great time in coming up with a budget plan. You could take your
                                net income and gather all of your monthly bills and find out how much will it take
                                to pay your monthly debts. By trying to maintain your budget and pay your expense
                                first can truly be beneficial to you at a later time. If you knew ahead of time
                                how much your expenses were this might deter you from spending any extra money on
                                your wants and living outside of your budget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There will be times when you will want to go out with your friends and family and
                                be able to enjoy yourself and have a good time, however if the money is not available
                                in your budget this may limit your time with them. So, it could be in your best
                                interest to sticking within your monthly budget, so that you are able to go out
                                with a few friends when the occasion arises.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Another great idea in limiting yourself to stay within your monthly budget would
                                just take cash with you when you go out. By keeping your credit cards home you will
                                be less likely to spend that extra money that you don’t have in your budget at this
                                time. What you don’t have you won’t spend.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You might want to go over your home and see if there are any leaks with the plumbing,
                                roof, and check on your winterization on your windows and doors. This could save
                                you some extra money every month and per year. You can do some preventative maintenance
                                on your home can truly save you some money which can benefit your monthly budget
                                with having to pay less on your utility bills. If you make some small interventions
                                this can accumulate to some extra savings that can help you with staying within
                                your monthly budget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The one thing that could be difficult for anyone that is having financial troubles
                                would be to pay your bills on time. By paying your bills on time and also save you
                                extra monthly with your monthly budget this can save you money on those late fees
                                that they tend to charge on everything. A few dollars here and a few dollars there
                                can add up in time and keep you off budget. If you are struggling on making your
                                payments on time call your creditors or a credit counselor, they could assist you
                                in this matter.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                By managing your budget and staying on a strict monthly budget can save you time
                                and money the key would be having some discipline and being consistent. By making
                                a few changes in your daily routine can truly add up to some savings within your
                                budget.

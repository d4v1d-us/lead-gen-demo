                                Loans to military personnel are a wonderful benefit offered to the men and women
                                who are or have served in our Armed Forces. Our military protects and defends our
                                Nation and therefore are often compensated by the business community with small
                                rewards not offered to the general public. Special borrowing opportunities are one
                                of the little benefits they receive, and their lenders usually offer lower rates
                                than conventional loans and credit cards. Often military personnel have unexpected
                                expenses such as travel emergencies or vehicle repairs that must be taken care of
                                immediately. Larger loans to military personnel might be necessary to cover greater
                                expenses such as buying a car or consolidating debt. Lenders make the process of
                                applying and receiving a loan much easier and the funds can be quickly transferred
                                into any bank account in the world.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are a variety of types of loans to military personnel. Soldiers can borrow
                                money to purchase a car, boat, motorcycle, RV, computer, or take a vacation. There
                                are also loans for emergency situations like home or vehicle repairs, or traveling
                                for a death in the family. Whatever the situation, personal or otherwise, there
                                is a lending option available. Usually, all soldiers have to do is provide proof
                                of service with a leave and earning statement. Often collateral is not necessary.
                                Those who can provide proof of continued military income will be approved. Often
                                former soldiers are employed to help with the process of granting these loans. Due
                                to their prior armed forces experience, the loan officers are able to relate in
                                a way someone else might not be capable of. Using the expertise acquired through
                                military service the loan officers are able to walk armed forces personnel through
                                the process of applying.
                                <br />

                                Military payday loans are generally small cash advances to qualified military personnel
                                based on a military person's ability to repay. They are usually in the vicinity
                                of $500 or less. To receive this funding, a borrower will give the lender a postdated
                                check for a withdrawal authorization from their own bank account. There is a fee
                                for this type of loan and it is generally in the ten percent range. When a military
                                person receives the cash advance, he or she receives it less the loan fee.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                With this type of funding, the lender holds the check or electronic debit authorization
                                for a week or two. This is usually the time frame for the borrower's to pay back
                                payday loans. At that time, the borrower has the option of paying back the cash
                                in exchange for the original check, letting the lender deposit the check in the
                                lender's account, or renewing or rolling over the loan. This process can continue,
                                allowing the loan to extend over a length of time, but the lender is receiving payment
                                for every extension period. Because military personnel receive a steady income and
                                can be easily approved with government identification, military payday loans are
                                easy to access and qualify for. They can be accessed from any part of the world.
                                The Internet provides the ability to apply for and receive quick cash from them.
                                Because of the job status with the armed forces, a loan can generally be extended
                                to those with bad or no credit.
                                <br />

                                Military personnel have been the targets of lenders because of their steady income,
                                inexperience in financial matters (usually young new recruits), the government's
                                assurance that the money will be repaid, and the soldier's current circumstances
                                of low incomes and large responsibilities. Loans to military personnel should be
                                explored only as an emergency option, and not for day to day living.

                                To find out more about this type of credit, one can search the Internet. There are
                                payday loans that can be applied for over the Internet, and the cash will be electronically
                                e-mailed to the borrower's bank account. The Internet can also reveal more information
                                about the fees associated with this type of loan. Consumers are encouraged to read
                                and discover as much information about military payday loans as possible before
                                making a financial commitment to a lending agency.

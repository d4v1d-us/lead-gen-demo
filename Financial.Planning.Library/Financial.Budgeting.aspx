                                <br />

                                The only “B” word other than bankruptcy that people hate to hear during financial
                                planning is budget. But the word has gotten a bad reputation. Literally, the financial
                                budgeting just means establishing a plan.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you budget, you are spending with a purpose before the month even begins. Instead
                                of spending your money before you make it, plan where it goes before you spend it.
                                Financial budgeting is strictly spending your money with intention. In fact, by
                                doing so, you will experience more freedom than before. If you can create a realistic
                                budget and be consistent with it, you will find that you have even more money at
                                the end of the month.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                To get a grip on how the budget in your household should look like, take financial
                                planning and budgeting seriously by asking yourself a few questions. How much income
                                do I have coming in? Include every penny. How much do I owe in bills every month?
                                You need a written financial budget or you will not stick to it. You're financial
                                budget is telling you where your money will go, instead of you asking yourself weeks
                                later what happened to it all. Always spend your money on paper first before actually
                                handing it to someone else.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A new system financial planners are using today is called the Envelope System. It
                                goes back to the old days when people used to use cash envelopes to budget. You
                                can implement it today as a simple step towards financial planning and debt reduction.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1. Budget each paycheck. Put on paper down to the last dime how you are going to
                                spend it, do this BEFORE you get paid.
                                <br /><br />
                                2. Create categories like food, gas, clothing, and so on and make an envelope for
                                them. All other major bills will come directly out of your bank account. Leave enough
                                money in your account to cover your bills and your bank fees, and cash the rest.
                                <br /><br />
                                3. Fill up your envelopes according to what is on your budget. If you have budgeted
                                $400 for gas one month, put that in your envelope, and not a penny more.
                                <br /><br />
                                4. Use your envelopes for the purposes you have defined and nothing else. When the
                                money is gone, it is gone. You are done spending for that envelope or category.
                                This means no visits to the ATM. That won't matter anyway because you won't have
                                money in there and your bills will be paid. Doesn't it feel good?
                                <br /><br />
                                5. Do not let temptation like debit cards get you. Spending cash seems to hurt more
                                psychologically as you see it physically go away. Make this a habit and get rid
                                of the debit card.
                                <br /><br />
                                6. It is true you will need to make adjustments as not all bills come in at the same
                                time. Your budget needs to be structured around your pay periods.
                                <br /><br />
                                7. Have some fun. It will not hurt you to have an envelope just for fun if your budget
                                allows for it. Knowing you have a “no rules” envelope may make things a little less
                                stressful for you and easier to follow your budget.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Once you plan your budget, give it a few months to actually work for you. Do not
                                get discouraged after 30 days and give up. It will not be perfect the first time,
                                this is new to you, remember? Plan every penny on paper before the month starts.
                                After you have done this for a few months, you will see that it works. If it doesn't,
                                analyze the areas you are struggling with. Rewrite your budget, and continue with
                                your financial plan. If you are realistic with what you have, you will have the
                                success you are looking for in a matter of time.

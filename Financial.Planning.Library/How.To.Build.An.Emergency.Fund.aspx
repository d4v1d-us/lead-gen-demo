                                Do you live paycheck to paycheck? Has your car broken down and you didn’t have the
                                money to fix it? Have you had an unexpected expenses pop up and you were not able
                                to pay it? Well you are not alone as many of us have had the same experiences that
                                you have had with no emergency funds, it’s how we handle them that makes us a better
                                person for it.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Have you often wondered what would have happened if you had an emergency fund account
                                that you were able to access when your car broke down or that utility bill was extra
                                high this month? Well it can happen, but with a few tips, some consistency, and
                                some discipline on your part the next time that your car breaks down or another
                                unexpected expense pops up remember that a few dollars a day over a period of time
                                could have paid for this.
                                <br />

                                As a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck some find the need to have an
                                emergency fund available to them as emergencies arise. As most of us find this task
                                very difficult to achieve it can be done with a few cut backs on your part and even
                                your family can assist you in by cutting back on any extras that they don’t need.
                                It is good idea to have an emergency fund available to you that can pay for a few
                                months of your expenses. I know that sounds like a lot of money, but in time in
                                can be done and just as little as a few dollars a day. As many of us will have unexpected
                                expenses like our car breaking down or your water heater goes out in your house.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Having an emergency fund can be very easy to start, but the most important factor
                                is to be consistent. Setting a certain amount of money aside every week or every
                                paycheck can truly lead to an emergency fund that can some day save your car.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Once you start putting away towards your emergency fund make sure the funds are
                                not readily available to you as the temptation could be greater than you realize.
                                As most people are living on a tight budget and find it hard to set aside any money
                                for their emergency fund but in the long run it will be worth it. If you are able
                                to set aside $25 - $50 per paycheck this would be a great place to start your emergency
                                fund.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Some have stated that you might want to treat your emergency fund as another bill
                                that you have to pay. Program your brain to making this payment towards your emergency
                                fund and you might find it easier to manage.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As many of us know that setting aside money for our emergency fund can be a very
                                difficult task, but when you are saving for your retirement which is called a 401K
                                this money is taken out before taxes and it put directly into another account. This
                                is also another way to put extra money aside and not even miss it. You can compare
                                this to your emergency fund and treat it the same way.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Having an easy access to your emergency fund can be difficult to avoid and not having
                                easy access can both be trying and difficult to avoid. So when you are ready to
                                start your emergency fund make it an account that is something that is not easily
                                accessed by your and/or your spouse.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When bills come up or your kids might want something it is so easy to justify the
                                need and if you have an easy access to your emergency funds there is a more likelihood
                                that you will succumb to the desire of just taking a few dollars out of your emergency
                                fund. Your emergency fund account truly needs to be just that, for emergencies only.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you don’t see the funds the likelihood that you won’t miss it can only benefit
                                your emergency fund to grow over a period of time and before you know it your emergency
                                fund will have more than you realize.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As your emergency fund grows you might want to start thinking about putting some
                                or all of it into a money market account. Earning some interest on your emergency
                                fund can benefit you if you stick to the plan. When you have at least one month
                                of emergency funds you might want to put it on a one-month CD. When the time that
                                the CD matures you can roll it over to another one-month CD. If you are not sure
                                about your options or what to do about your emergency fund you can always talk to
                                your bank. They are a great resource to have in assisting you in growing your emergency
                                funds.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As you get more money in your emergency fund you might think about a money market
                                account. There are many accounts and CDs to invest in for a short time, so you are
                                able to grow your emergency fund account. Doing a little bit of research and asking
                                family and friends in how they invest some of their money is a great way to start
                                growing your emergency fund account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Remember the first step with getting an emergency fund started is being aware of
                                your financial expenditures and stop the wanting purchases as this can deter you
                                from your goal of having an emergency fund available to you when you need it the
                                most. Do you have the need to have an emergency fund account? As most will state
                                yes, the first place to start is to find out where your current money is going now.
                                By finding out exactly where your money is currently going can give you a great
                                place to start in finding out how much you can truly set aside for your emergency
                                fund account.

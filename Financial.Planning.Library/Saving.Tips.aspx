                                Using a Financial Budget to Increase your Savings
                                <br />
                                <br />
                            </p>

                                Anyone that has tried to create a sound financial budget or has at least heard that
                                it is good to have one knows that a savings plan is critical to any financial budget.
                                It is critical to have savings plan in place regardless of your goal.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You may want to have a saving plan for a vacation in a few years, savings for retirement
                                or college funds, or simply to have emergency cash on hand in the even of unexpected
                                expenses. Many people know they need to have a saving plan, but have no clue where
                                to start. This article will provide some basics to creating a good financial budget
                                that includes saving.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                1. First find out what you need to save for and how much it will require. For long-term
                                goals like retirement, you will need to do some planning and probably talk to a
                                planner or nvestor. For short-term goals, you simply need to know how much it costs
                                and how you can put aside money away weekly towards that goal.
                                <br /><br />
                                2. Do not buy what you do not need. It is that simple. Learn how to distinguish
                                between what is a need and what is a want. You NEED a roof over your head; you do
                                not NEED a new video game.
                                <br /><br />
                                3. Set a savings goal. Once you know how much you need to save, decide on your timeframe
                                – I may have a down payment for the house two years from today. Be realistic, not
                                idealistic.
                                <br /><br />
                                4. Decicde how much you will be saving every week or every paycheck. It is best
                                to put aside the same amount each period.
                                <br /><br />
                                5. Pay yoruself first. Saving should be your priority. Deposit your savings into
                                an account as soon as you are paid. You can even set up an automatic transfer with
                                your bank so that you won't even miss the money.
                                <br /><br />
                                6. Keep a record of your expenses. This is all part of your financial budget. Later
                                you will be trying to decide what to trim out of your overall spending.
                                <br /><br />
                                7. Reassess your savings plan. If you simply cannot fit all of your savings goal
                                in one finanancial budget, cut more from your overall plan or extend the timeframe.
                                Maybe you will need to put off the house purchase for another year for example.
                                <br /><br />
                                8. Write out your financial budget on paper and keep it somewhere you can see it
                                every day. Once you have balanced your earnings with your savings goal, you can
                                see for yourself how much you are spending and exactly where.
                                <br /><br />
                                9. Stick to the budget no matter how hard it is. If you stray from it, it loses
                                its point entirely and you will be back to square one in debt with no savings in
                                no time.
                                <br /><br />
                                10. Open a high interest saving account. It is much easier to keep track of your
                                savings if they are far away from you and separate from your spending cash. Get
                                it at the same bank you do your checking and this way you can simply transfer from
                                your checking to savings at your allotted weekly or bi-weekly time to do so.
                                <br /><br />
                                11. Don't use your credit cards. This is the quickest, though most difficult way
                                to reduce spending. Use cash as much as possible as you will then be more aware
                                of what you are spending your money on. If you simply must have credit cards, but
                                them in a tupperware box with water and store it in the freezer. Thaw your card
                                only when you really need it. Your card will not suffer damage, and you will force
                                yourself to use cash until an emergency arises.
                                <br /><br />
                                12. If you receive unexpected cash like a bonus or inheritance, put all or most
                                of it in your savings.
                                <br /><br />
                                13. Once you have met your obligations for a car or house loan, you will have extra
                                money. Put that into savings, and this way the money you used to pay someone else
                                now goes to you.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                In this day and age of credit and debtloads, it is very difficult to stick to a
                                solid savings plan. If unexpected expenses cause you to stray from your budget from
                                time to time, do not stress about it. As soon as your unexpected expense is out
                                of the way, resolve to yourself to get back on track as soon as possible. These
                                simple tips can be started today, and within one year you will have a solid savings
                                account, and a very sound financial budget.

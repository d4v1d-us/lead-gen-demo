                                Emergency loans are becoming increasingly popular today and that is probably due
                                to the fact that you can not go anywhere it seems without seeing an advertisement
                                for them. These ads quickly and efficiently convey the message that you can get
                                access to cold hard cash through an emergency loan in less than an hour.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Most make sure to confirm that you don't need good credit to qualify as such. Is
                                this wrong? No, there is nothing untruthful about their claims. Are emergency loans
                                a good idea? Well that is a different question all together. The answer is, it all
                                depends on what type of financial consumer you are, and how savvy you are at keeping
                                your money under control.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Emergency loans have been called a number of things, payday loans cash advance,
                                or emergency loans. Typically they are required by the average consumer for an emergency
                                situation – unexpected car repair, the furnace goes out, Spot gets sick. Unfortunately
                                however, because emergency loans are so easy to obtain, they very quickly stop becoming
                                used for emergency purposes, and become an easy way to get cold cash fast. All that
                                is required for an emergency loan these days is a pay stub, and a half decent checking
                                account. The idea is that you promise to pay your emergency loan back with your
                                next paycheck.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The typical emergency loan consumer carries the profile of having a moderate income,
                                low to bad credit scores, and lives from paycheck to paycheck. Or, they survive
                                from government check to government check. They come in with the application, checking
                                account information, income verification and they leave shortly after with cash
                                and a post-dated check missing from their book. For the moment, the emergency loan
                                meets their immediate needs. Because these borrowers are often living day to day
                                financially, they don't see the potential costs that emergency loans and cash advances
                                will incur.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The alternatives to emergency loans are taking out of your 401K, cash advances on
                                your credit card, or home equity loans. Unfortunately, with all of these supposedly
                                better alternatives, you are affecting your credit rating. Furthermore, each of
                                these “solutions” to the emergency loan also come at a cost. With your 401K or IRA,
                                taking money out of a tax deferred investment account is a bad idea. You are going
                                to be charged 10% penalty for withdrawing early for starters. You will also have
                                to pay income tax on anything you get. The cash advances on your credit card are
                                going to come at a higher interest rate than standard credit card purchases, some
                                even as high as 30%. You are also going to be charged a fee just to access the cash,
                                generally around 3-5%. When you add it up, this is more expensive than going with
                                a payday loan. The Home Equity loan or line of credit is the safest of the other
                                three alternatives, but you still pay interest on whatever you obtain. At the same
                                time, it is not the most practical solution to re-mortgage your home if you simply
                                need to pay a vet bill.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you consider the alternatives, you can see that emergency loans and payday
                                loans are not always a bad idea. We all experience unexpected expenses, and not
                                everyone can afford a savings plan. If you are good with your finances, you can
                                have the advantages of an emergency loan without staying in debt. If not, you will
                                pay for it, and incur another bill to your debt load. If the money is not in your
                                bank on your post-dated timeline, you will begin to incur fees. These will come
                                not only from your lender, but from your bank as well who will charge you NSF fees.

                                The key to using emergency loans and cash advances is to pay them back when you
                                say you will. It is okay to need money in an emergency situation. As long as you
                                are careful, emergency loans can be a good alternative for you if you are out of
                                options.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The most popular time to better sell your home is the spring, however the best time
                                to sell your home onto the market is when the interest rates are low. It’s all about
                                timing and you definitely want rates to be low as this will give you better options
                                to sell your home when you purchase next your home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You might want to consider selling your home on your own. You could reduce the cost
                                up to 6% of your selling price, as this won’t go to a realtor and increase your
                                seller options.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are several different ways to sell your home, you can put a for-sale sign
                                in your front yard, put an ad in your local newspaper, and/or list it on the internet.
                                As many homeowners are turning to the internet for assistance and location.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you decide to sell your home yourself, be patience as it may take longer.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you go with an agent/realtor be sure to look for a ‘seller’s agent’, as they
                                will do their best to sell your home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When looking for an agent, ask how many houses they have sold in the last year,
                                how many in your neighborhood and ask them to communicate with you their process
                                and what they are going to do to sell your home
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you have selected an agent you will sign a listing agreement, DO NOT sign one
                                for more than three months. If they are not able to sell your home or you are not
                                satisfied with them you can cut your losses and move on.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Now it’s time to take a look at selling your home. Does it need updating? Got too
                                much junk inside? Now would be the time to de-clutter, update if needed, and maybe
                                do some painting with neutral colors. Remember, potential home buyers want to be
                                able to see themselves in your home, so make it easy for them to see that and sell
                                your home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                You might want to give some type of incentive for your potential buyer, maybe offer
                                to pay closing costs, a home warranty, or pay points to sell your home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Understanding the process and learn about negotiating can only be beneficial to
                                you as the seller. Knowledge is power and can save you money to sell your home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The asking price, compare your neighborhood and the real value of your home. As
                                your potential buyer will do the same. Selling your home can take some time so plan
                                ahead and be realistic.

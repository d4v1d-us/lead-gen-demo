                                So you want to buy a home? Do you have any money for a down payment? Are you looking
                                for a zero down home loan when you are buying a home? What exactly does it take
                                to do to buy a home? How does my credit report and credit score hurt or help me
                                in buying a home?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Have you ever asked yourself these types of questions before? Many of us have asked
                                ourselves this many times as you are not alone in this adventure, as many Americans
                                have the ultimate dream of buying a home. But what can we do to get started, do
                                I have to earn a lot of money, what exactly are my options of mortgages?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This can be very difficult questions to answer if you are just starting out and
                                are not aware of the expectations of buying a home. Just about everyone that you
                                know would like to buy a home as we call it it is our dream. Always remember to
                                educate yourself before you buy a home and review your options with different mortgages.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Ideas you might want to utilize before you make that down payment. It is recommended
                                that you pay off your debts before buying a home, any high interest debts like credit
                                card debts, car loans, if possible, student loans. As this can make a difference
                                with the amount that you are able to borrow against with you buying a home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Most mortgage companies will not allow you to borrow money for buying a home if
                                your expenses are over 40% of your income. It would be beneficial to you if you
                                pre-qualified for buying a home this will allow you to know exactly on where you
                                stand. You will know if your debt to income ratio is enough to buy a home or you
                                might have to pay of some more debt in order to get your debts below 40% of your
                                income.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you pre-qualify the lender will set a certain amount that you are able to buy
                                a home as this can be your basis to start with.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you are at the moment when you can start planning on your monthly mortgage
                                payment from buying a home you will want to make sure that you are able to make
                                the monthly mortgage payments. It is recommended that when you buy a home that your
                                mortgage and homeowner’s insurance does not exceed about 28% of your gross income.
                                As this is not always the case, this is just a recommendation as most of us live
                                beyond our means and we will do whatever it takes to buying a home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Don’t forget that you do have the options for different mortgages when buying a
                                home, so shop around and get the best mortgage rate that you can. Some of your options
                                can be a 15 or 30 year traditional mortgage as this can lock in your rate and your
                                payment will remain the same throughout your payment process. If you go with a variable
                                rate you take the risk of paying out more money as the interest rates do change
                                from time to time and they can always go up or down depending on the status of the
                                economy. Utilizing the traditional mortgage rate is very predictable when buying
                                a home and you know what to expect.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are also other options out there that you can choose from which is a non-traditional
                                mortgage when buying a home and one is called a ‘piggy back’ loan which is two loans
                                on top of one another. The first one is the principal of your loan which is your
                                30 year mortgage and the second one is the 15 year mortgage that is 10% of your
                                home that you would pay less for when buying a home with your down payment. The
                                benefits of utilitzing the piggy backed loan would be that you wouldn’t have to
                                put that much money down when buying a home, but you will have to pay for your mortgage
                                insurance which is also known as your PMI. Most people who are buying a home will
                                go with their private insurance company for their homeowner’s insurance, if they
                                can’t afford the 20% down payment, as most can not afford this.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Sometimes utilizing the piggy backed loans can be more expensive when you are buying
                                a home than your 30 – year mortgage and you might also pay higher closing costs.
                                This might be another question that you might ask your lender for the different
                                closing costs and what it will cost you.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you do have any credit problems you can always go to the Federal Housing Authority,
                                better known as FHA. There are known to allow people to buying a home to be able
                                to do so for up to only a 3% down payment, which can include your closing costs
                                if requested. Your closing costs can be put into your mortgage if you do not have
                                the funds, just ask your lender if there is anything that you can put onto your
                                mortgage to allow you to cut your cost that will allow you to come up with a little
                                or no money down on you buying a home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are limitations on how much that you can borrow through an FHA loan, so make
                                sure you ask and find out all of the requirements. There are other mortgage loans
                                out there look around and do your research as this will only benefit you. Another
                                great way to buying a home is to ask your friends and family with you they used
                                in their own mortgage process and how did they like them.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                It might be a great idea when buying a home to sit down and write down everything
                                that you would like to know and what exactly are your expectations in buying a home.
                                This is a great way to start the process of getting what you want for as little
                                money as possible.

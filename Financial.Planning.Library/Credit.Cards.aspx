                                Are you confused with all of that mumbo jumbo on your credit card statement? Are
                                you aware of all of the fees on your credit card statement? Do you know what they
                                mean?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Well you are not alone as many of us have at least one credit card and many others
                                may have several credit cards as we are all in the same boat with all of that credit
                                card jargon and excess fees that are being charged and shown up on our statements.
                                Some creditors rely on the consumer to quickly fill out the application and quickly
                                start the process of charging their fees without even thoroughly reading their documentation
                                that is provided.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you get a credit card application in the mail marked “Your Pre-approved” you
                                get a little bit excited wondering how did that happen? Just remember the ole saying
                                ‘if something appears to good to be true, it usually is’. You don’t get something
                                for free, when you are reviewing that credit card application look at the fine print
                                and the other documentation enclosed as this will have all of those darn nasty hidden
                                fees.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                So, as many of you have received those credit card preapproval cards in the mail
                                you will want to review every word of their loan agreement. As many of us are in
                                dire need of some extra money and we are more likely to just sign on the dotted
                                line for a quick fix to our financial needs but do beware of all of those small
                                words that you may have overlooked, rest assured they do mean something and I’m
                                sure you would rather know now rather than when you receive your first credit card
                                statement and see several fees being charged to your credit card.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There are a lot of hidden fees and high interest rates that the creditors hope that
                                you don’t see like a start up fee, activation fee, over the limit fee, and the late
                                payment received fee. Over time these fees can quickly add up to over your principal
                                amount purchased and you can quickly find yourself in deep credit card debt.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                So, before you decide to fill out that credit card application to get a quick credit
                                card be aware of the potential dangers to your credit and all of the hidden fees.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                GRACE PERIOD: Most credit card companies usually have a grace period between 20
                                to 30 days. If paid during the grace period your credit card will not be charged
                                interest and if you don’t have a grace period on your credit card the interest starts
                                from the time you make your purchase.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                ANNUAL FEES: This is a charge from the credit card companies that charge their clients
                                to have an account with them. Usually the annual fees for credit cards range from
                                $35 – $50 and this is usually charged with customers that have less than perfect
                                credit.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                PENALTY RATE: This is when you make a credit card payment late. The credit card
                                company will incur this fee to your credit card statement state that your payment
                                was late. After making a late payment, this is when the credit card companies tend
                                to increase your interest rate. So, read the fine print as credit card companies
                                have this stipulated in the credit card application that they will drastically increase
                                your interest rate if your credit card payment is received late.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The average penalty rate on a credit card is about 23%, which normally with good
                                credit your credit card interest rate should be around 6–12%. As you start to make
                                your payments on time some creditors will lower your interest rate to your credit
                                card.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                BILL PAYMENT FEES: Now that we are in the 21st Century, On-line banking has become
                                very popular as this allows us to pay our bills either on-line or by the phone.
                                As some creditors charge for this service, make sure that you mail your bill as
                                soon as you can to avoid a late fee.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                INTRODUCTORY RATES: As most credit card companies have this ‘Introductory Rate’
                                that they offer to new credit card applicants to try and get your attention and
                                business. This is historically only valid for the first few months to get your business
                                or further requirements maybe required. You might want to ask how long does this
                                interest rate last, new purchases only, transferring your balances on your credit
                                card and what other requirements there are to continue this low interest rate. And
                                if you make a late payment how will this affect your low interest rate on your credit
                                card. Also, if there is a debt that hasn’t been paid off during the introductory
                                period there may be interest retroacted.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                UNIVERSAL DEFAULT CLAUSE: This is what the small print at the bottom of your credit
                                card application refers to, this notifies the consumer that it is the creditors
                                policy to increase your interest rate on your credit card if you make a late payment
                                on the account and not just theirs.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Creditors do track your payment history with regards to your other accounts by reviewing
                                your credit report. By making your credit card payments on time you can avoid an
                                increase in your interest rate.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Just remember, with every pre-approved credit card application there will always
                                be those hidden fees that you are just not aware of or just didn’t take the time
                                to read their brochure. Your first step you should be to review the credit card
                                application and become fully aware of all of their hidden credit card fees. Thoroughly
                                read all of the documentation given for late fees, over the limit fees, cash advance
                                fees, application fees, and any other miscellaneous fee that you might not beware
                                of. Secondly, call the creditor and ask any additional questions that you may have
                                about new purchases, do you have a grace period, are credit card cash advances available
                                and at what cost, and can I pay my bill on-line with no fees, etc.
                                <br />
                                <br />

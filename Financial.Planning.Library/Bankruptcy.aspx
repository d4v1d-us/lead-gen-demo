                                Meaning a reorganization of one’s assets that allows you to keep certain properties
                                that may give you three to five years to pay off your current debts. The court will
                                assign a trustee to monitor your repayments and to provide documentation to your
                                creditors regarding your financial information.

                                <br />
                                This type of bankruptcy involves liquidating all of one’s assets. Depending on your
                                state, some items maybe exempt such as home, car, household items, clothes, furnishings,
                                and pensions. Your property can be sold by a court appointed trustee, which usually
                                takes about four to six months. You are allowed to file once every six years and
                                this filing will remain on your credit report for ten years.

                                <br />
                                This bankruptcy is generally for businesses that want to reorganize. This type of
                                bankruptcy allows businesses to continue their operations while repaying their creditors
                                through a court approved plan. Once you have decided to file for bankruptcy, you
                                must file your paperwork in federal court. There is usually a filing fee of about
                                $200 some places allow you to make payments. This is usually down by a bankruptcy
                                attorney, your best bet is to contact your family or friends a get a personal referral.
                                As dealing with any attorney they too will have their additional fees along with
                                your filing fee. So beware and do your homework.

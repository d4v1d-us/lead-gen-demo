                                1. Stick to a Budget<br />
                                Budgeting is not a four-letter word. How can you know where your money is going
                                if you don’t budget? How can you set spending and saving goals if you don’t know
                                where your money is going? You need a budget whether you make thousands or hundreds
                                of thousands of dollars a year.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                2. If You Don’t Have a Savings Plan — Start One Now<br />
                                You’ve heard it before: Pay yourself first! If you wait until you’ve met all your
                                other financial obligations before seeing what’s left over for saving, chances are
                                you’ll never have a healthy savings account or investments. Resolve to set aside
                                a minimum of 5% to 10% of your salary for savings BEFORE you start paying your bills.
                                Better yet, have money automatically deducted from your paycheck and deposited into
                                a separate account.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                3. Pay Off Credit Card Debt<br />
                                Credit card debt is the number one obstacle to getting ahead financially. Those
                                little pieces of plastic are so easy to use, and it’s so easy to forget that it’s
                                real money we’re dealing with when we whip them out to pay for a purchase, large
                                or small. Despite our good resolves to pay the balance off quickly, the reality
                                is that we often don’t, and end up paying far more for things than we would have
                                paid if we had used cash.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                4. Get Paid What You’re Worth and Spend Less Than You Earn<br />
                                It sounds simplistic, but many people struggle with this first basic rule. Make
                                sure you know what your job is worth in the marketplace, by conducting an evaluation
                                of your skills, productivity, job tasks, contribution to the company, and the going
                                rate, both inside and outside the company, for what you do. Being underpaid even
                                a thousand dollars a year can have a significant cumulative effect over the course
                                of your working life. No matter how much or how little you’re paid, you’ll never
                                get ahead if you spend more than you earn.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                5. Contribute to a Retirement Plan<br />
                                If your employer has a 401(k) plan and you don’t contribute to it, you’re walking
                                away from one of the best deals out there. Ask your employer if they have a 401(k)
                                plan (or similar plan), and sign up today. If you’re already contributing, try to
                                increase your contribution. If your employer doesn’t offer a retirement plan, consider
                                an IRA.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                6. Invest!<br />
                                If you’re contributing to a retirement plan and a savings account and you can still
                                manage to put some money into other investments, all the better.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                7. Maximize Your Employment Benefits<br />
                                Employment benefits like a 401(k) plan, flexible spending accounts, medical and
                                dental insurance, etc., are worth big bucks. Make sure you’re maximizing yours and
                                taking advantage of the ones that can save you money by reducing taxes or out-of-pocket
                                expenses.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                8. Review Your Insurance Coverages<br />
                                Too many people are talked into paying too much for life and disability insurance,
                                whether it’s by adding these coverages to car loans, buying whole-life insurance
                                policies when term-life makes more sense, or buying life insurance when you have
                                no dependents. On the other hand, it’s important that you have enough insurance
                                to protect your dependents and your income in the case of death or disability.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                9. Update Your Will<br />
                                70% of Americans don’t have a will. If you have dependents, no matter how little
                                or how much you own, you need a will. If your situation isn’t too complicated you
                                can even do your own with software like WillMaker from Nolo Press. Protect your
                                loved ones. Write a will.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                10. Keep Good Records<br />
                                If you don’t keep good records, you’re probably not claiming all your allowable
                                income tax deductions and credits. Set up a system now and use it all year. It’s
                                much easier than scrambling to find everything at tax time, only to miss items that
                                might have saved you money.

                                A paycheck advance loan allows the consumer to apply for money based on the paycheck
                                that has not yet been received. This can alleviate a consumers worries about stretching
                                the dollar until the next pay day, or even eliminate the stress of paying for that
                                unexpected expense that may arise. Paycheck advance loans are readily available
                                to those in a financial crunch. The process is quick and convenient as many lenders
                                can be accessed through the internet.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This form of financial assistance, much as the name suggests, is a loan that provides
                                money until the individuals next paycheck arrives. Although there are no stipulations
                                as to how the consumer can use a paycheck advance loan, many people use them to
                                pay their bills on time or to pay for unexpected emergencies, such as a leaking
                                roof or a car repair. Some people may use paycheck advance loans to finance other
                                things such as a vacation or shopping spree. Before seeking and agreeing to funds
                                of this type, it is important to consider the circumstances and whether there is
                                a legitimate need for this money.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Assistance in this form is easy to obtain because there is no credit check involved.
                                Most lenders require that the borrower is at least 18 years old, has a checking
                                account open and in use for at least 90 days, and has a take-home earning of at
                                least $1200 per month. Some companies may have other stipulations. An interested
                                consumer can get a paycheck advance loan at a cash advance company where they will
                                have the individual post-date a check for the amount that is qualified for, plus
                                the fees for the transaction. Online companies typically allow the consumer to conduct
                                the application completely electronically or via a fax machine. If approved, the
                                funds will be deposited directly into the banking account that was designated by
                                the individual.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This funding is meant to be a small, short-term loan. The amount of money the individual
                                qualifies for will depend upon their income as well as any other factors the lender
                                may have. Once the consumer is approved for a paycheck advance loan the money will
                                be deposited into their account or available to within 24 hours of the application.
                                Paycheck advance loans can be useful financial tools if they are handled with the
                                mindset of being emergency options for things needed, not things desired. It is
                                important to read closely the fine print of the companies' lending policies so there
                                are no surprises or unexpected charges. Finally, use caution and intelligence when
                                dealing with financial matters, including cash advances. Taking advantage of the
                                Internet, professional financial counselors, and many other resources will allow
                                the individual to make good decisions.

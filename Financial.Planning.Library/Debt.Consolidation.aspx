                                Every paycheck we ask ourselves about debt consolidation, “Where did my money go?”
                                or “I thought I had more.” When there is no plan or current budget we often ask
                                ourselves these same types of questions. We often wonder what we can do about it
                                when we live paycheck to paycheck. Fortunately, for most of us there is a way to
                                survive and get out of debt with some simple planning and budgeting ideas that we
                                can implement in our daily lives, which is called debt consolidation.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Some easy ways for debt consolidation is by trimming your expenses back which can
                                be right under your nose and you may not even realize it. Most of us have often
                                wondered how we can save some extra money or cut our current expenses, but how we
                                go about it often stumps us
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Here are some ideas about debt consolidation that could cut your monthly expenses
                                and be able to maintain a manageable budget by consolidating your debts:
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                A. With debt consolidation you should write down every expense you have daily, weekly,
                                and monthly. Every time you go to the gas station or you grab something quick to
                                eat. A little everyday can add up to a lot at the end of the month.
                                <br /><br />
                                B. With debt consolidation when making purchases use cash, if you don’t have it you
                                probably don’t need it. If you use your credit card to make purchases, just remember
                                to be cautious when making purchases if you can’t pay off at the end of the month
                                then you might want to refrain.
                                <br /><br />
                                C. With debt consolidation utilities in your home, saving on electricity, gas, and
                                water can save you some money, if done consistently. You may want to educate your
                                family on turning the lights off when not in a room. Visit your local utility company’s
                                website and find more ways to reduce your monthly costs.
                                <br /><br />
                                D. With debtconsolidationadjusting your thermostat in the winter and in the summer
                                can save you more money. Open your windows, purchase fans, and if you have an attic
                                fan, use it it’s a great alternative to keeping your house cooler.
                                <br /><br />
                                E. With debt consolidation, packing your lunch to work, have fun with it and allow
                                yourself a treat or two. Bringing your lunch to work can save you about $5 per day,
                                $25 per week, and $1,300 per year.
                                <br /><br />
                                F. With debt consolidation, cancel any extras in your household like your newspaper,
                                internet, cable, or maybe just get the basic package. Call your provider and inquire.
                                <br /><br />
                                G. With debt consolidation shop at discounted grocery stores, now they are everywhere.
                                <br /><br />
                                H. With debt consolidation clip coupons and watch for those great sales.
                                <br /><br />
                                I. With debt consolidation carpool or use public transportation, if possible.
                                <br /><br />
                                J. With debt consolidation use your bank services, when using an ATM only use your
                                bank this allows you to stay away from the service fees that you will be charged.
                                Most ATMs charge some type of fees $1–3 dollars per transaction.
                                <br /><br />
                                K. With debt consolidation, balance your checkbook. Be proactive with your account
                                and watch out for unknown charges and challenge them.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The key to debt consolidation is to have a plan and stick with it. In the long run
                                you will thank yourself for all of your hard work.

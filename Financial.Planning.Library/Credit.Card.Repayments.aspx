                                Having a credit card can definitely help you when you might need it the most, but
                                those darn advance fees can really hurt when your statement arrives. By getting
                                your credit card cash advances can assist you with getting quick and immediate cash
                                for your emergency financial need, but at a price. If at all possible you should
                                try to avoid getting cash advances on your credit card as those fees can end up
                                costing you more than you bargain for. Just remember that receiving your credit
                                card cash advance there are no grace period with this. So, remember to read your
                                credit card statement and become fully aware of all of those hidden fees that might
                                be charged to your credit card statement.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Those fees that are charged for receiving cash advances on your credit card can
                                be very costly to you. These fees are acquired by the creditors calculating your
                                fees using two methods. Some credit card companies base their fees on a percentage
                                basis, which can add up to 1% – 4% and some other credit card companies may to charge
                                you a flat fee. A flat fee charge would not fluctuate solely based on the advanced
                                that you received with your credit card as this fee would remain the same.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As some credit card companies might charge you with both of these methods. For example
                                they might charge you a certain percentage based on the money that you received
                                from your credit card and a flat fee for the opportunity to do this. So, be sure
                                to read your credit card statement and if you have ANY questions with regarding
                                to any fees that you see on your credit card statement call their customer service
                                immediately and inquire about it. It never hurts to ask and you never know it just
                                might be an error on their part.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you are one of the lucky ones that your credit card company does not charge this
                                fee you would be in great shape just remember to make your payments on time.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you have decided that you need to get an advance from your credit card make sure
                                you don’t use an ATM machine. As most ATMs machines will charge you a fee for this
                                service, remember that the fee is being charged by the financial institution that
                                you are trying to retrieve money from.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                One of the biggest pitfalls for us when we get an advance on our credit card would
                                be the finance and interest fees. The interest rate will often be much higher than
                                the normal purchase rate. If you get a cash advance on your credit card the cash
                                advance rate is usually between 20% to 25%. So, remember the average credit card
                                purchase rate is between 15% to 17%. So as you can see this could drastically increase
                                your monthly expenses, so use this credit card cash advance wisely as it may cost
                                your more in the end.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                There may also be other finance charges that involve the grace periods and the payment
                                method that you may use to make your payment for your credit card. When you have
                                received your credit card cash advance at this time is when your interest starts
                                accruing and that is why there would be no grace period. So you believe that if
                                you pay your credit card bill in full when your statement arrives that you will
                                be ahead of the game you will be wrong. So, when you do receive your credit card
                                statement make sure you review it carefully and be aware of all of the fees and
                                charges that you are paying for.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As you might not beware of it, but thus the manner that your payments are applied
                                to your account can make a difference. When you make your payment most credit cards
                                issuers make their credit card payment towards their purchases, as a rule most creditors
                                automatically apply your payment to those credit card purchases that you have made.
                                So, if your credit card has a balance this might be the reason for any extra finance
                                and/or interest fees that you might see on your credit card statement. When making
                                your payment for your credit card cash advance call your creditor and make the payment
                                over the phone and specifically ask for your credit card payment to go directly
                                to your cash advance.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Have you ever received those credit card checks in the mail with your credit card
                                statements? Have you ever been tempted to use them? Well after this you might want
                                to shred them as the credit card company sees them as credit card cash advances
                                and are subject to the same terms as your credit card cash advance would be. We
                                as consumer find those checks to be another easy access to our credit card cash
                                advance and easy spending money. Just remember when something seems to free or easy
                                to utilize it usually comes with some hidden agenda or large fees.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                If you have become dependent on your credit card cash advances there might be some
                                debt problem. If you regularly rely on your credit card cash advances to be able
                                to make ends meet you might want to find another alternative to pay your bills off
                                and these fees can quickly accumulate over time and before you know it your fees
                                can and will be more than what you actually borrowed against your credit card.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Even though the credit card cash advance is very easy to use, don’t get into the
                                habit as using this as a quick fix as there maybe another issue at hand. There are
                                many additional financial resources out there that can be beneficial to you and
                                may save you time and money from those credit card fees. A great way to stop this
                                cycle would be to consider having a monthly budget.

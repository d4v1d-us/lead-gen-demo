                                So you are ready to plan for your financial future but don't know where to begin.
                                You don't even know what financial planning is. Where do you start? Do you need
                                to hire someone? Do you need to be wealthy to even consider it?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The fact is no, you do not need to be Donald Trump. You just need to be motivated
                                to prepare for the future. You may need a little bit of capital, but your financial
                                planner will help you with all of that. And yes, you will more than likely need
                                to seek

                                From an expert. You are going to want to. Preparing for having money in your retirement
                                age is a serious undertaking and you want it to be done properly. This article is
                                going to give you a step by step guide to the financial planning process. This will
                                give you a better guide of what to expect when you seek out your financial advice
                                from an expert.
                                <br />

                                Financial planning is an ongoing process that requires several steps. The end result
                                will be your financial plan. Do not expect this plan to be set in stone. You will
                                experience life along the way and with that comes medical expenses, job loss, goal
                                changes, and well, life. Keeping a solid relationship with your financial planner
                                will help ensure you can sail through these bumps.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When you seek financial advice, your financial planning will start with determining
                                what your financial personality profile looks like. Financial planning begins with
                                determining your net worth which is what is left over after your liabilities are
                                subtracted from your assets. Your financial planning will then take into account
                                your current income, lifestyle, risk tolerance, current financial responsibilities,
                                and financial resources. From this a financial profile will then be created for
                                you as the first major step in the financial planning process. Once you have your
                                financial planning profile, you will get financial advice based on your needs assessment.
                                This is going to basically determine what your needs are to maintain your current
                                lifestyle, AND prepare for retirement at the same time. This will consist of your
                                debt obligations, housing expenses, recurring expenses (such as a car payment),
                                and other monthly bills.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The combination of these two profiles will help your planner establish your cash
                                flow analysis – what you have coming in, what you have going out, what you need
                                to save. Your financial planning journey will then determine what your goals and
                                objectives are for the future. This will include whatever it is you are preparing
                                for – retirement, estate planning, vacations, college funding, or whatever it is
                                you are planning for. Knowing these goals ahead of time is key to your financial
                                planning success. When you have discovered where you are, what you have, and where
                                you want to be, your financial plan will fall into place.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Your planner will give you financial advice on an individual plan that is meaningful
                                to you. The following financial goals may be established, and SHOULD be discussed
                                with your planner: emergency fund, insurance, tax planning, debt management, savings
                                plan, retirement planning, and estate planning. It is not necessary to take a bit
                                out of each cookie right now, but at least making yourself aware of these things
                                will make your financial planning process that much easier.
                                <br />

                                You financial planners are going to be a group of experts that comprise a team.
                                Each of which you will use at different stages of your life, and throughout your
                                financial planning process. Each area of expertise requires a specialist in the
                                field. And if you are considering more than one of the financial goals listed above,
                                it is a good idea to consult more than one financial planning expert. Examples of
                                these include tax planning through a certified accountant, estate planning through
                                an attorney, insurance companies and agents to handle your insurance needs, debt
                                consolidation experts to handle your debt management, a financial investor to be
                                in control of your investments. It is unlikely you will use each of these experts
                                simultaneously, but if you want sound financial planning, you will use more than
                                one or each of these experts throughout your financial planning process.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Each financial plan is as unique as the individual that controls it. Some use a
                                variety of professionals, others do not. Either way, proper financial planning will
                                put you on the path to retirement success.
